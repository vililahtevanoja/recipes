# Glazed Vegetables

## Ingredients

- `700 g` vegetables (carrots, pearl onions, turnips, radishes, rutabaga), peeled and cut into 2.5cm pieces
- `0.5 tsp` cornstarch
- `3.5 dl` homemade or low-sodium canned chicken stock
- `2 tbsp` unsalted butter
- `2 tbsp` sugar
- Kosher salt
- `2 tbsp` finely minced fesh parsley or chives
- `1.2 dl` (optional) toasted slivered almonds
- `0.5 tsp` lemon zest and 1
- `0.5 tsp` lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Toss the carrots with the cornstarch in a 30cm heavy-bottomed stainless steel skillet until no clumps of starch remain. Add the stock, butter, sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are almost tender (they should show little resistance when poked with a cake tester or the tip of a knife), about 10 minutes.
1. Increase the heat to high and boil, tossing occasionally, until the sauce is reduced to a shiny glaze. Remove from the heat, add the herbs, almonds, lemon zest and lemon juice, and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
