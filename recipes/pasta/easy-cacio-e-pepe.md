# Easy Cacio e Pepe

## Ingredients

* `224 g` spaghetti
* `100 g` Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Panado, finely grated
* `150 g` pecorino, finely grated
* `15 g` extra-virgin olive oil
* toasted black peppercorn
* `10 g` cornstarch
* `150 g` water
* salt

## Instructions

1. Combine cornstarch and water into a mixture. Pour the mixture to a small pot and bring it to medium-low heat. Keep it under a simmer and keep stirring it and making sure it has no clumps. You should see it has a viscous quality. When done, bring off heat and let cool.
1. Meanwhile add the grated pecorino and parmigiano reggiano to a container, alongisde with the freshly cracked toasted black pepper and the extra-virgin olive oil. Once the starch mixture has cooled a little bit, pour it all into the container and start mixing it with a fork. Blend the whole thing with a hand mixer to create a stable and thick emulsion.
1. Boil the pasta in a small amount of water, just enough to cover them.
1. Add a couple of table spoons of pasta water and a couple of heaping spoonfuls of the cheese emulsion into a skillet, and mix those together. Add the pasta and start mixing them together and turn the heat to low. Mix to cream the ingredients together. Add pasta water if needed. You need to be a little bit careful with the heat.
1. Serve with toasted peppercorn and grated pecorino on top.
