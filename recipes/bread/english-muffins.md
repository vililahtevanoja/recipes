# English Muffins

## Ingredients

- `400 g` strong white flour (plus extra for dusting)
- `1 tsp` caster sugar
- `5 g` fast-action yeast
- `1 tsp` salt
- `250 ml` whole milk (warmed)
- fine semolina (for dusting)

## Instructions

1. To make the dough, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, and `1 tsp` salt in a large bowl. Gradually add the milk, mixing with your hands until the dough comes together. Knead for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic. This can also be done in a tabletop mixer with a dough hook.
1. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll to 1 cm thick. Cut out 8 circles using a 7.5 cm cutter, re-rolling the dough if needed. Arrange on semolina-dusted baking trays. Dust the tops with more semolina, cover loosely, and leave to rise in a warm spot for about 1 hour or until doubled in size. For a better flavour, leave to prove overnight in the fridge.
1. To cook the muffins, place a heavy-based frying pan or griddle over medium heat for 6–7 minutes on each side until golden brown. Do this in batches. If the muffins brown too quickly, lower the heat and leave until cooked through. Set aside to cool slightly on a wire rack. Best served warm.

_Will keep in an airtight container for up to three days. Leave to cool first._
