# The Best Garlic Bread

## Ingredients

* `2 loaves` soft deli-style Italian bread, about 450g each
* `60ml` extra-virgin olive oil
* `8 tbsp` unsalted butter
* `12 medium cloves` garlic, minced or microplaned
* `2 tsp` dried oregano
* `0.5 tsp` red pepper flakes
* Kosher salt
* `60 g` Parmigiano Reggiano (optional)
* `1 tbsp` chopped fresh parsley leaves (optional)

## Instructions

1. Adjust the oven racks to the upper- and lower-middle positions and preheat the oven to 500C. Split each loaf of bread lengthwise and then crosswise into 8 pieces.
1. Combine the olive oil and butter in a 30cm skillet and heat over medium-high heat until the butter melts. Add the garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat.
1. Dip the cut side of each piece of bread in the garlic butter and arrange them on two foil-lined rimmed backing sheets. Spoon any extra garlic butter evenly over the bread. Season with salt. If desired, use a microplane to grate the Parmigiano Reggiano evenly over the pieces of brea. Place in the oven and bake until toasted and bubbly, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh parsley, if desired. Serve immediately.
