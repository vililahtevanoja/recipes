# Crumpets

## Ingredients

- `150 g` white flour , plain / all purpose
- `200 ml` warm water
- `0.5 tsp` salt , cooking/kosher salt `0.25 tsp table salt`
- `0.5 tsp` white sugar
- `1 tsp` baking powder
- `1 tsp` dry yeast
- `1 tbsp` warm water
- `2 tbsp` butter

## Instructions

### Batter

1. Place flour, water and salt in a bowl and whisk for 2 minutes (electric beater 1 minute on speed 5).
1. _Yeast Mixture_ - Dissolve Yeast into 1 tbsp warm water in a small bowl.
1. Add Yeast Mixture, sugar and baking powder into bowl, then whisk for 30 seconds (or 15 sec speed 5).
1. Cover with cling wrap or plate, then place in a very warm place for 15 to 30 minutes until the surface gets nice and foamy. It will only increase in volume by ~10 - 15%.

### Cooking crumpets

1. Grease 2 or 3 rings with butter (approx 9 cm / 3.5" wide, though any ring or metal shaper will do) (TIP: Non stick rings - brush with melted butter. Everything else - smear with butter)
1. Brush non stick skillet lightly with melted butter then place rings in the skillet.
1. Turn stove on medium high (medium for strong stoves) and bring to heat.
1. Pour `50 ml` batter into the rings (65ml), about 1cm deep (will rise ~60%).
1. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes - bubbles should start appearing on the surface (but not popping yet).
1. Turn heat down to medium, cook for 1 minute - some bubbles should pop around the edges.
1. Turn heat down to medium low, cook for a further 2.5 to 4 minutes, until the surface is "set" and it's clear there will be no more bubbles popping! (At this stage you can help the final bubbles pop with a skewer!)
1. Remove rings (you might need to run knife around to loosen).
1. Then flip and cook the other side for 20 to 30 seconds for a blush of colour.
1. Transfer to write rack (golden side down) and fully cool.
1. Can be eaten once cool, but it's even better the next day (Note 5).

### Eating crumpets

1. Toast in a toaster until the base is crispy.
1. Slather generously with butter, then spread of choice (honey is perfection) and devour immediately!
