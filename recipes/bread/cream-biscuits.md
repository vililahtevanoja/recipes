# Easy Cream Biscuits

## Ingredients

- `280 g` all-purpose flour
- `1 tbsp` baking powder
- `0.75 tsp` kosher salt
- `4 tbsp` unsalted butter, melted
- `300 ml` heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 220°C. Place the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add 2 tablespoons of the melted butter and the cream and stir with a wooden spoon until a soft dough comes together.
2. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead gently until it forms a cohesive ball. With a rolling pin, roll it into an approximate 20 cm square, 2 cm thick. Use a 7.5 cm round biscuit cutter to cut out biscuits and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them 2.5 cm apart. Gather up the scraps, reroll, and cut out more biscuits (you should end up with 8).
3. Brush the top of the biscuits with the remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter. Bake until the biscuits are golden brown and well risen, about 15 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve.

### Cream Scones Variation

Add `3 tbsp` sugar to the dry mixture in step 1. Fold in `120 ml` currants or raisins if desired.
