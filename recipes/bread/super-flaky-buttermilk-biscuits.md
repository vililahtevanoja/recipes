# Super-Flaky Buttermilk Biscuits

## Ingredients

- `120 ml` buttermilk
- `120 ml` sour cream
- `280 g` unbleached all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting
- `1 tbsp` baking powder
- `0.25 tsp` baking soda
- `1.5 tsp` kosher salt
- `120 g` cold unsalted butter, cut into 1 cm pats
- `2 tbsp` unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 220°C. Whisk together the buttermilk and sour cream in a small bowl.
1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and process until blended, about 2 seconds. Scatter the butter evenly over the flour and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal and the largest butter pieces are about 6 mm at their widest. Transfer to a large bowl.
1. Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and fold with a rubber spatula until just combined. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead until it just comes together, adding extra flour as necessary.
1. With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 30 cm square. Using a bench scraper, fold the right third of the dough over the center, then fold the left third over the center to form a 10×30 cm strip. Fold the top third down over the center, then fold the bottom third up so the whole thing is reduced to a 10×10 cm square. Press the square down and roll it out again into a 30×30 cm square. Repeat the folding process once more.
1. Roll the dough again into a 30 cm square. Cut six 10 cm rounds out of the dough with a floured biscuit cutter. Transfer the rounds to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2.5 cm apart. Form the dough scraps into a ball and knead gently two or three times, until smooth. Roll the dough out again until it’s large enough to cut out 2 more 10 cm rounds, and transfer to the baking sheet.
1. Brush the top of the biscuits with the melted butter and bake until golden brown and well risen, about 15 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve.

### Variations

#### Cheddar Cheese and Scallion Biscuits

In step 4, sprinkle `170 g` grated cheddar cheese and `60 ml` sliced scallions over the 30 cm dough square before folding it the second time, and continue as directed.

#### Bacon Parmesan Biscuits

In step 4, sprinkle `120 ml` crumbled cooked bacon and `60 g` grated Parmigiano-Reggiano over the 30 cm dough square before folding it the second time, and continue as directed. Dust the biscuits with more grated Parmesan before baking.

#### Flaky scones

Add 2 tablespoons sugar to the dry ingredients in step 2. In step 4, if desired, scatter 1 cup frozen or chopped fresh fruit or berries over the dough before folding it the second time. In step 5, roll the dough into a 30cm-by-10cm rectangle, then cut the rectangle into three 10cm squares and cut each square into 2 triangles. Sprinkle the scones with an additional 2 tablespoons sugar and bake as directed.
