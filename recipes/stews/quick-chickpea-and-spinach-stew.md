# Quick Chickpea and Spinach Stew

## Ingredients

* `800 g` canned whole tomatoes
* `2,5 cm` knob of ginger, peele
* `60 ml` extra-virgin olive oil
* `1` medium onion, finely sliced
* `4 cloves` garlic, finely sliced
* `1 tsp` sweet or hot Spanish smoked paprika
* `340 g` spinach, trimmed, washed, drained, and roughly chopped
* `800 g` canned chickpeas, with their liquid
* `2` bay leaves
* `2 tsp` soy sayce
* Kosher salt
* Sherry vinegar (optional)

## Instructions

1. Drain the tomatoes in a strainer set over a medium bowl. Transfer the liquid and half of the tomatoes to a blender, add the ginger, and blend on high speed until completely pureed. Set aside. Roughly chop the remaining tomatoes and set aside separately.
1. Heat the olive oil in a 30cm skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, garlic and paprika and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is softened and very slightly browned. Add the tomato-ginger puree and stir to combine. Add the spinach a hanful at a time, allowing each handful to wilt before adding the next. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the spinach is completely tender, about 10 minutes.
1. Add the chopped tomatoes, chickpeas, with their liquid, bay leaves, and soy sauce and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened into a thick stew, about 30 minutes.
1. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately, drizzling with extra virgin olive oil and, if desired, a few drops of sherry vinegar.
