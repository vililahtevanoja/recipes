# All-American Pot Roast with Gravy

## Ingredients

- `2.3 kg` boneless chuck roast, pulled apart at the seam into large chunks, excess fat and gristle trimmed
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- `2 tbsp` vegetable oil
- `4` anchovy fillets
- `2` medium cloves garlic, finely minced or grated
- `1 tsp` Marmite
- `1 tbsp` soy sauce
- `2 tbsp` tomato paste
- `2` large carrots, peeled and cut into 2.5 to 5 cm chunks
- `2` stalks celery, cut into 2.5 cm chunks
- `2` large onions, finely sliced (about `4 cups`)
- `2 tbsp` all-purpose flour
- `750 ml` dry red wine
- `1 litre` homemade or low-sodium canned chicken stock
- `21 g` (3/4-ounce packet) unflavored gelatin
- `2` bay leaves
- `4` sprigs fresh thyme
- `450 g` russet baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 2.5 to 5 cm chunks

## Instructions

1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat the oven to 135°C (275°F). Pat the chuck roast dry and season it with salt and pepper. Tie kitchen twine tightly around each piece at 2.5 cm (1-inch) intervals to help it retain its shape.
1. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until lightly smoking. Add the chuck and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the beef to a large bowl.
1. Meanwhile, combine the anchovy fillets, garlic, Marmite, soy sauce, and tomato paste in a small bowl and mash with the back of a fork until a smooth, homogeneous paste is formed.
1. Return the pot to medium-high heat, add the carrots and celery, and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables begin to brown around the edges, about 5 minutes. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until very soft and light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the anchovy mixture and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the flour and cook, stirring, until no dry flour remains, about 1 minute. Increase the heat to high and, whisking constantly, slowly add the wine. Bring to a simmer and cook until the wine is reduced by half, about 15 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, pour the chicken stock into a large liquid measuring cup or a bowl and sprinkle the gelatin on top. Allow it to hydrate for 10 minutes.
1. Add the gelatin and chicken stock, bay leaves, and thyme to the Dutch oven, return the beef to the pot, and bring the liquid to a simmer. Cover, leaving the lid slightly cracked, place in the oven, and cook until the beef is completely tender (it should offer little to no resistance when you poke it with a cake tester or thin knife), 3 to 4 hours; add the potatoes to the pot about 45 minutes before the beef is done. Remove the pot from the oven and allow to cool for 1 hour.
1. Transfer the whole pot to the refrigerator and let rest at least overnight, or up to 5 nights.
1. When ready to serve, carefully remove the hardened layer of fat from the top of the cooking liquid and discard. Transfer the meat to a cutting board. Discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat and reduce it until it coats the back of a spoon but doesn’t taste heavy. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. Meanwhile, remove the twine from the beef and slice it against the grain into 1.25 cm (1/2-inch) thick pieces. Place the pieces in overlapping layers in a 30 cm (12-inch) skillet and add a few ladles of sauce to moisten them. Cover the skillet and set over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until the meat is heated through, about 15 minutes.
1. Transfer the meat to warmed serving plates or a large platter and top with the cooked vegetables and more sauce. Serve immediately.
