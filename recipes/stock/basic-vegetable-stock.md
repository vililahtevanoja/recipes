# Basic Vegetable Stock

## Ingredients

- `30 g` unflavored gelatin (or agar agar for vegan)
- `2` large onions, roughly chopped
- `2` large carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
- `4` stalks celery, roughly chopped
- `1` large leek, trimmed
- `250 g` mushroom stems and scraps and or whole mushrooms
- `2` Granny Smith apples, quartered
- `2` bay leaves
- `2 tsp` whole black peppercorns
- `1 tsp` fennel seeds
- `1 tsp` coriander seeds
- `6 sprigs` fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Pour 4 cups of water into a medium bowl and add the gelatin. Set aside until gelatin is hydrated, about 10min.
1. Meanwhile, put the onions, carrots, leek, mushrooms, apples, bay leaves, peppercorns, fennel, coriander, and parsley in a large Dutch oven or stockpot and add cold water to just cover the ingredients. Add the hydrated gelatin and water and bring to a simmer and cook for 1 hour, adding hot water as necessary to keep the ingredients submerged.
1. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth into a large bowl and discard the solids. Return the stock to the pot, bring to a simmer and reduce to 2 liters, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. The stock will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or it can be frozen for up to 3 months.
