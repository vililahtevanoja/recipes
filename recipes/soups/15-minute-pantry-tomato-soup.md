# 15-Minute Pantry Tomato Soup

## Ingredients

- `3 tbsp` unsalted butter
- `1 large` onion, finely diced (about `180 g`)
- Pinch of red pepper flakes
- `0.5 tsp` dried oregano
- `1 tbsp` all-purpose flour
- Two `794 g` cans whole tomatoes (with their juice)
- `120 ml` whole milk or heavy cream (½ cup)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- `2 tbsp` whiskey, vodka, or brandy (optional)
- `2 tbsp` extra-virgin olive oil
- `2 tbsp` chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley, basil, or chives) (optional)

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the pepper flakes and oregano, and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the flour and cook, stirring for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, with their juice, and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan. Add the milk or cream and simmer, stirring occasionally and breaking up the tomatoes with the spoon, until the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes.
1. Remove the soup from heat and puree using an immersion blender or transfer to a standing blender in batches. Return to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the alcohol, if using, and bring to a simmer. Serve immediately with a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of herbs, and freshly ground pepper.

**Note:** Serve with Extra-Cheesy Grilled Cheese Sandwiches.
