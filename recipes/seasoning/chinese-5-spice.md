# Chinese Five-Spice Powder

## Ingredients

* `1 tbsp` Sichuan peppercorns
* `6` star anise
* `1.5 tsp` whole cloves
* `1 stick` cinnamon
* `2 tbsp` fennel seeds

## Instructions

1. Toast all the spices in a wok or skillet over low heat for a few minutes to evaporate the moisture and activate the aroma. If you have a couple of spices that are already a powder form, reserve them, and mix at the end.
1. Let the spices cool before putting them into a spice grinder. Blend the spices as fine as possible. Mix with the reserved spice powder.
1. Store the five-spice powder in a sealable container.
