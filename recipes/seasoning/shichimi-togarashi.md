# Shichimi Togarashi

## Ingredients
  
* `2 tbsp` red chili flakes (dried and ground shishito peppers preferred)
* `1 tbsp` dried orange peel (use less, about 1 teaspoon, if making nanami togarashi)
* `2 tsp` white sesame seeds
* `2 tsp` black sesame seeds
* `1 tsp` sansh≈ç or sichuan peppercorns
* `1 tsp` ginger powder
* `0.5 tsp` teaspoon poppy seeds
* `0.5 sheet` quality toasted nori , crumbled

## Instructions

1. In a dry skillet, lightly toast the white and black sesame seeds, sichuan peppercorns and poppy seeds until fragrant, being careful not to burn them.  Transfer to a bowl and let them cool completely.  
1. Place all of the ingredients along with the nori in a spice/coffee grinder and pulse until coarsely ground (be sure it's coarse and not a fine powder).
1. Store in an airtight jar.  For optimal flavor use within a few weeks.
