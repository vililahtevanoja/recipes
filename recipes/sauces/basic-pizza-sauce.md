# Basic Pizza Sauce

## Ingredients

- `800 g` canned whole tomatoes (San Marzano)
- `2 tsp` salt (1 per small can)
- `bunch` of fresh basil
- garlic (optional)

## Instructions

1. Place peeled tomatoes in a large bowl and gently squash them by hand. Use a tomato masher if needed. If using a hand blender, pulse quickly, and don't over blend them.
1. Add salt to the crushed tomatoes, around 1 teaspoon per small can.
1. Tear basil leaves by hand and mix into the sauce with a spoon until well incorporated.

### Notes

- If you want thicker sauce you can strain some of the liquid away.
