# Toum

## Ingredients

- `130 g` garlic cloves
- `1-2 tsp` salt (1 table salt, 2 for Diamon Crystal kosher salt)
- `60 g` fresh lemon juice from about 2 lemons, divided
- `60 g` ice water, divided
- `600 g` neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola oil, divided

## Instructions

1. Using a paring knife, split each garlic clove in half lengthwise. With the tip of the knife, remove the germ from each garlic clove half.

### Food processor method

1. Place the de-germed garlic and kosher salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse garlic in short bursts until finely minced, occasionally removing the lid to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a flexible rubber spatula. Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and continue processing until a paste begins to form. Add another tablespoon lemon juice and process until completely smooth and slightly fluffy.
1. With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in 1.2 dl oil in a very thin stream, followed by 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Repeat with another 1.2 dl oil and remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Continue the process, alternating 1.2 dl oil and 1 tablespoon water, until all the oil and water have been incorporated. Transfer toum to a container and store in the fridge for up to 1 month.

### Mortar and pestle method

1. Depending on the size of your mortar, you may need to make the recipe in smaller batches, halving or quartering the ingredient amounts. In the mortar, combine garlic and salt and grind until it becomes a smooth paste. Work oil into paste 1 teaspoon at a time. After adding 1 tablespoon oil, work in a few drops of lemon juice. Repeat until all the oil, lemon juice, and water have been incorporated.

### Notes

- For the ideal light and fluffy texture, stick with either the food processor or mortar-and-pestle method described here. Trying to make the toum in a blender or with an immersion blender will result in a thin and dense texture closer to that of a mayonnaise or dressing than traditional toum.
- If the emulsion breaks, it can easily be brought back together with the help of an egg white. Combine 1 egg white with 0.5 dl of the broken emulsion in the bowl of a food processor until fluffy. With the food processor running, slowly pour in the remaining broken emulsion.
