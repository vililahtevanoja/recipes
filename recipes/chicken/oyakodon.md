# Oyakodon

## Ingredients

- `1 pc` chicken breast, boneless, skinless, thinly sliced (can use thigh as well)
- `0.25` white Onion, sliced (about `0.5`)
- `1` large egg, whisked
- `1 stalk` green onion, thinly sliced
- `120 ml` dashi broth (can use Hondashi seasoning), can substitute for chicken or vegetable broth
- `1 tbsp` mirin, Japanese sweet wine (optional)
- `1 tbsp` soy sauce
- `1 tsp` sugar
- `1 tsp` sesame Oil
- `240 g` japanese short grain rice, cooked
- toasted sesame seeds

Note: Additional soy or sugar may be needed to adjust seasoning

## Instructions

1. To make your own dashi/sauce: In a bowl, mix dashi, mirin, soy sauce, sesame oil, and sugar. Mix until sugar is dissolved. This is going to be the dashi sauce.
1. In a small frying pan add your dashi with the onions and bring to a boil over high heat.
1. Then add in your chicken making sure it is in an even layer. Cover with a lid, bring to a boil, and cook for roughly 2-3 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are soft and tender.
1. Remove the lid, there should still be some liquid in the pan. Slowly drizzle in your beaten egg.
1. Turn the heat to low-medium, cover with the lid, and cook to your desired egg liking. Traditionally the egg is cooked to a more runnier silkier consistency.
1. Assembly: Serve over a bowl of rice and top with sliced green onions and sesame seeds.
