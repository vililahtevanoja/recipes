# Buttermilk Pancakes

## Ingredients

- `140g (10 tbsp)` unsalted butter
- `600g (~12 dl)` all-purpose flour
- `12g (2.5 tsp)` salt (I use coarse kosher)
- `60g (4 tbsp)` granulated sugar
- `2g (0.5 tsp)` baking soda
- `25g (5 tsp)` baking powder
- `900g (9 dl)` buttermilk
- `4` large eggs
- Grassfed salted butter and maple syrup for serving

## Instructions

1. Place butter into a pan over low heat and melt.  Set aside.
1. In a medium bowl, combine flour, salt,sugar, baking soda, and baking powder. Whisk the dry ingredients until the salt and leaveners are evenly mixed throughout.
1. In a second bowl, combine buttermilk and eggs. Whisk  until well blended. If you can’t find buttermilk, combine 500 grams of sour cream with 400 grams of water as a substitute.
1. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients and carefully fold to combine. Start with 10 gentle stirs.
1. Stream in half of the melted butter and fold gently. Then, add the remaining butter and fold for another 30 seconds. Be careful not to overmix the batter; it should remain lumpy.
1. Heat a griddle or non-stick pan to 175-190°C. Use a about `1 dl` of batter per pancake.
1. Drop the batter onto the preheated griddle or pan with a `1 dl` measure and smooth it out into a round shape.
1. Cook for 2-3 minutes on the first side until golden brown. Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes on the second side.
1. To check if the pancakes are done, give them a quick poke. If they are firm and do not cave in, they are ready. If they cave in, continue cooking.
1. Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep them warm in a low oven if cooking multiple batches.

### Tips

- This recipe yields 12-14 pancakes. If using a non-stick pan, cook one pancake at a time over medium-low heat, flipping after 3 minutes.
- Serve the pancakes with a pad of room temperature salted grassfed butter between each and a proper pad of butter on top.
