# Kaiserschmarrn (Scrambled Pancakes)

## Ingredients

- `224 ml` milk
- `4` large eggs
- `3 dl` cups all-purpose flour
- `1 tbsp` sugar
- `2 tbsp` butter
- icing sugar

## Instructions

1. Beat milk and eggs together until well combined. In a separate bowl combine flour and sugar, then pour milk and eggs over dry ingredients and mix until combined.
1. Heat skillet over medium-high heat, and add butter. Once butter has melted add batter and cook undisturbed until bottom has begun to brown, about 4 minutes. Using a spatula, scramble the pancake batter, then allow to settle and brown on the bottom again. Repeat until batter is cooked into many slightly browned sections. Serve sprinkled with icing sugar alongside fruit preserve or compote.
