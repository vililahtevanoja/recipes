# Fresh Ricotta in 5 Minutes or Less

## Ingredients

- `950 ml` whole milk (4 cups)
- `0.5 tsp` table salt
- `60 ml` distilled white vinegar or lemon juice (from 2 lemons, 0.25 cup)

## Instructions

1. Line a colander with four layers of cheesecloth or two layers of food-safe paper towels and set over a large bowl. Combine the milk, salt, and vinegar in a microwave-safe 2-quart liquid measure. Microwave on high until lightly bubbling around the edges, 4 to 6 minutes; the milk should register about 74째C (165째F) on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the microwave and stir gently for 5 seconds. The milk should separate into solid white curds and translucent liquid whey. If not, microwave for 30 seconds longer and stir again. If necessary, repeat until fully separated.
1. Using a slotted spoon or wire skimmer, transfer the curds to the prepared colander. Cover the exposed top with plastic wrap and allow to drain until the desired texture is reached. Leftover ricotta can be stored in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

## Variation

You can make this recipe on the stovetop instead of the microwave. Heat the milk and vinegar mixture in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a silicone spatula to prevent sticking or scorching until it reaches 74째C (165째F) on an instant-read thermometer. Remove it from the heat and allow it to rest until solid white curds form on the surface, about 2 minutes.
