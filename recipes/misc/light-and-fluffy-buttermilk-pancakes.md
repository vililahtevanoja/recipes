# Light and Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes

## Ingredients

- 1 recipe Basic Dry Pancake Mix (above)
- 2 large eggs, separated
- `355 ml` buttermilk (1½ cups)
- `240 ml` sour cream or buttermilk (1 cup)
- `57 g` unsalted butter, melted (4 tablespoons)
- Butter or oil for cooking
- Warm maple syrup and butter for serving

## Instructions

1. Place the dry mix in a large bowl.
1. In a medium clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream until homogeneous. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking. Carefully fold in the egg whites with a rubber spatula until just combined. Pour the mixture over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be some lumps).
1. Heat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle). Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. Use a `60 ml` (¼-cup) measuring cup to place 4 pancakes on the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining pancakes in 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and butter.

## Blueberry Pancakes

Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons thawed frozen blueberries on top of each pancake as soon as you ladle them onto the griddle and proceed as directed.
